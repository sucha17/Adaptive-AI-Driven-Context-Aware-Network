## Part 1: Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Vision
The Adaptive AI-Driven Context-Aware Network is an advanced network architecture that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) as its core brain. Unlike traditional networks with static configurations, this architecture dynamically perceives contextual information (user behavior, location, traffic) and self-adapts in real-time. The goal is to optimize bandwidth, reduce latency, and ensure network continuity seamlessly.

### 1.2 Educational Objectives
- Apply Context-Aware computing concepts to layered network design
- Design AI-driven routing protocols and dynamic resource allocation
- Implement network behavior simulations based on real-world constraints
- Manage constraints such as data privacy, AI processing bottlenecks, and hardware limitations
- Create comprehensive architectural documentation

### 1.3 Scope and Constraints
| Aspect | In Scope | Out of Scope |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Architecture** | AI-driven traffic management, QoS prioritization | Designing specific physical AI chipsets |
| **Simulation** | Python/Software-based network simulation | Large-scale physical hardware deployment |
| **Context** | User behavior, App types, Time, Location | Deep personal tracking outside network scope |
| **Security** | AI decision fail-safes, privacy anonymization | Comprehensive global threat mitigation |
| **Testing** | Smart Campus, Smart Stadium, Emergency Cases | Deployment on fully legacy-only infrastructure |

## Part 2: Architectural Review

### 2.1 Architecture Overview
The architecture is built upon three core pillars:
1. **Self-Aware Network:** Continuously monitors real-time status including traffic volume, latency, node stability, and user context.
2. **Self-Adaptive Network:** Utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to make autonomous decisions, adjusting routing paths and prioritizing traffic without manual intervention.
3. **User-Centric Network:** Analyzes "who" is using the network, "what" application is running, and "where/when" it is accessed to provide the highest Quality of Experience (QoE).

*(Further layers and protocols to be detailed by the engineering team during Sprint 1 & 2)*
